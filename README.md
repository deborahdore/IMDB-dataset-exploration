# IMDB-dataset-exploration

Creating a good model always depends on the quality of the dataset. The exploration of the dataset is a big and important part in order to understand the data we are working with. A good understandment of the dataset can prevent making errors in the final part of the ML pipeline.

In this repo, we explored the IMDB dataset to understand its limits and formulate hypothesis with the use of graph made with R.
